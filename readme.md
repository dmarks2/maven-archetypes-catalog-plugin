Maven Archetypes Catalog Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
=================================================

IntelliJ IDEA lacks the possibility to fetch external Maven Archetype
Catalog files (archetype-catalog.xml). You had to add external Maven
Archetypes by hand.

This plugin for IntelliJ IDEA aims to integrate the possibility to define
a list of external Maven Archetype Catalog files. Those files are
fetched and the containing Maven Archetypes are added to the available
archetypes in IntelliJ IDEA.
